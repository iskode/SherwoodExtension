Multivariate normal distribution (C++)
--------------------------------------


= USAGE =

Use pmvnorm_P and pmvnorm_Q to calculate CDF and upper tail of CDF.

Read test.cpp for more details.

= About =

This is a simple wrapper of R package libmvtnorm (or Fortran code MVTDST).
I put here just because I cannot find a handy C++ version.
